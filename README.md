## Structure
>>>>>>> 7b9a01a5293ff9bf51cf95d4fcfe1af5ff70bd38
The website starts with a header, showing the title 'Art of the World' on the top-left corner.
When scrolling down, the background color presents itself.

Clicking on the three bars, and selecting any of the drop downs allows you to navigate the different parts of the website.

- These include:
  - Europe
  - Asia
  - Africa
  - Pie Chart

## Art section

- To best visualise and explain to the viewer the common styles of these art works,
  two features are used:
  - Text Grid: Explains the different attributes of art from these regions.
  - Slides: Scrolling through each slide starting from the right arrow shows examples of these attributes

The Africa section uses an image grid because the art form in that section or not paintings but displayable objects. For this reason, an image grid is more appropriate.

## Pie Chart

- The Pie chart uses data from the website but changes were made to make it more managable.
  - Using the Numbers software , nationalities which represented less than 20 people were remove. This was 87 nationalities. Despite this, the dataset is still massive
  - American artists were also not included in the pie chart because they represented more the 1,500 artists.

## Footer

- Contains three sections:
  - Useful links: Links to find out more about the gallery and find out about events
  - Magazine: Allows user to input their email to subscribe. Clicking the button without writing anything leaves a warning.
  - Shows Address information and stickers which are links to social media.
