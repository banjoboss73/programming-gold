    <!--Bulleted list to explain European art-->
    <p>Western art has seen many changes throughout its many years if existence. Most painings up until the mid-19th century were made in&nbsp;service to the church or royalty. As Europe started industrialising, painters started to move away from creating traditional pieces of&nbsp;art, such as The Scream, to art which addresses social issues faced by people of middle and lower classes.
      <br> An overview of paintings styles in Europe are: 
      <dl class="row">
        <dt class="col-sm-3">Expressionism</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-9">As indicated by the word 'expression', expressionists use emotion and blend it with reality. This is done by using unusual mixtures of colours to invoke the artists' feelings on the viewer.</dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-3 text-truncate">Abstract</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-9">As one of the more recent art styles to rise in popularity, many viewers feel it is an effortless mixture of colours without any meaning.</dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-3">Traditional</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-9">Most popular during the Renaisance, these pieces would be used in churches as large murals or even as small portraits. Traditional art takes reality as it is, using its accuracy and detail to amaze viewers.

    <!--Bulleted list to explain art in Asian countries-->
    <p>Art from the Asian continents vary depending on the region they originate from. It is less unified than European art because each country has its own distinct culture.
    <br>This is art from three regions in Asia:
    <dl class="row">
        <dt class="col-sm-3">Japan</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-9">Many well-known pieces from this region were created during Japan's feudal era. Art from this period was largely done on a woodblock print. Ukiyo-e would use this style to depict tantalising characters such as sumo-wrestlers, samurai or beautiful women.
        </dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-3 text-truncate">Mughal India</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-9">Thanks to the Mughal emperor, Akbar, Mughal art was recorded in manuscripts and kept in libraries. Mughal art would require a team of artists who specialised in caligraphy, bookbinding, or illumimnation.</dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-3">Traditional</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-9">Most popular during the Renaisance, these pieces would be used in churches as large murals or even as small portraits. Traditional art takes reality as it is, using its accuracy and detail to amaze viewers.

      <h2 style="margin-top: 100px;">Africa</h2>
      <p>African art is extremely diverse and takes many forms. Between the 14th and 18th centuries, most significant pieces took the form of objects formed out of clay, rock or precious metals.
        <br>This is art from three regions in Asia:
        <dl class="row">
            <dt class="col-sm-3">Sculptures</dt>
            <dd class="col-sm-9">Due to the fact that most sculptures depicted religious deities and were made out of precious metals, these pieces were less affordable and commonly used by loyalty or people from a higher social standing. 
            </dd>
            <dt class="col-sm-3 text-truncate">Masks</dt>
            <dd class="col-sm-9">Masks are usually adorned by hanging them on walls instead of actually being used in order to display their beauty and artistic value. It is one of oldest forms of art in the region, traced back to the stone age.</dd>
            <dt class="col-sm-3">Pots</dt>
            <dd class="col-sm-9">Despite how fragile clay pots are, African pots more than 400 years old have been preserved with details in the design still intact. This is because of their ritualistic importance in many cultures which requires them to be confined in protected spaces to be used for rituals (which sometimes meant breaking them on purpose).
